                <h4>Pitch</h4>
                <p>India's 2024 elections saw a discrepancy of about 500,000 votes between votes that were casted versus votes that were counted. That's a population larger than many cities.
                    Voting machines around the world do print paper records for every vote. to make each vote verifyable, but counting temp relies on a seprate device that requires mannual handling. This procees is slow, prone to error and weakens the public trust.
                    That is why I'm here to present Reco (short for reconcile). Reco is a voting machine that has a built-in counter, which automatically tallies each and every votes with the digitally recorded vote, eliminating discrepancies. 
                    It is also planned to have a camera, which records ONLY the generation of each and every paper ballot being produced, to make sure that no votes are cast outside the legal voting hours. This is a rising concern for elections in India.
                    By combining this existing techlogy to form a single device, every vote will be verifyable. This simple solution if implemented at a scale, could restore transparencies for billions of voters.
                    That is why sharks, to make a reco a reality, I want your support to move forward with this AB Bompi

                <h4>Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
                <p>What security measures will be implemented? Because your model will be containing a camera.</p>
                <p>Response: No votes will be captured in the timestamped video as the camera will be placed before the vote is being marked on the ballot, and it will only record it's generation.</p>
                <p>Will this machine only focus on India?</p>
                <p>Reponse: As the issue of paper ballots being handeled manually is a world-wide issue, including in the U.S., this will be a global solution.</p>
