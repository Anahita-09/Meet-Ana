## Music Covers Journal - October 20, 2025

# Total time: 5 hours (20% art time of the total project time)

# 11:00am - 1:00pm: 
I started recording with "Kal Ho Naa Ho" by Sonu Nigam. Since this song is a lengthy one it took some time to get familiarized with the notes and play it in a rhythm. So I recorded a few trial clips first to make sure everything is playing so=moothly and then recorded the final version.

2:00pm - 4:00pm:
I then moved to the shorter and fun coverings like "Senorita" by Camila and Shawn Mendes, "Bella Ciao" by Manu Pilas, and "Gurenge" by Lisa (YES the Demon Slayer song!). The beats of these songs were catchy and repetitive so it was very fun and easy to play.

6:00pm - 7:00pm:
During this last session I recorded the last song "Jeena Jeena" by Atif Aslam, this song has a very smooth rhythm. That is why I wished I could do strumming for this one. But I tried and it was just not happening for me so I stuck to playing the notes.

Throughout and before the session, I made some videos to practice before starting and also to track my progress on playing the song properly. The notes helped me a lot in being able to learn and record all these songs in such a short amount of time. 

Below I am attaching a compilation I made at the end of my sessions, enjoy!. To listen to the final versions, please go my website Meet-Ana.
